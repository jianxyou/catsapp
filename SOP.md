Standard Operating Procedure for Application Usage

1,Initial Application Interface:
Upon opening the application, users are presented with three interfaces: 'Scales', 'Data', and 'PDF'. Each interface serves a distinct purpose:
Scales: This interface is dedicated to the primary task of filling out various scales (forms or tables).

Data: After completing the scales, users can click on this interface to automatically generate SQL statements. These statements facilitate the execution of tasks in Access software, thereby eliminating the need for manual data entry.

PDF: Users can generate PDF files to store participant data after completing the scales.

2,Using the 'Scales' Interface:
Inside the 'Scales' interface, there are three options: 'Participant', 'Administrator', and 'Pet'. Each button leads to different scales that need to be filled:
The 'Administrator' initiates the process by guiding the 'Participant' to complete all the scales under the 'Participant' and 'Pet' categories. Once the 'Participant' and 'Pet' scales are selected, the iPad can be handed over to the participant for completion.
After the participant completes their part, the 'Administrator' completes the scales available under the 'Administrator' category.

3,Post-Scale Completion:
Once all the required scales are duly completed, navigate back to the main interface. Sequentially click on the 'Data' and 'PDF' buttons to generate and save the required data.

4,Saving the Files:
The saved files are stored within the 'Files' app on the iPad, specifically in the 'On My iPad/CaTS Research' directory.

5,Transferring and Utilizing Files:
Transfer the txt and PDF files to a computer. Run the SQL files in Access for data processing. The PDF files serve as a backup for the recorded data.
