This is an app for IOS devices, aimed specifically at the iPad Air (5th generation). 

I developped it using Typescript, Javascript and React Native. 

Its purpose was to digitally collect data for studies by a lab at Mcgill Univeristy. The research deals with psychiatric diagnostic tools, such as Beck Anxiety Indicator, Fagerstorm Test for Nicotine Dependence and many others. While these tools are copyrighted, this app uses them for non-commercial means and me nor the lab that employed me will never profit from it, making it legal in the eyes of copyright law. Further, this app is not available on a public marketplace, so it does not negatively effect the copyright holders.
